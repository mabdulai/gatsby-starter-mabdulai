# mabdulai-gatsby-starter

The default Gatsby starter adjusted by @mabdulai.

I created my own gatsby starter so I can easily start up a new project with the technologies I prefer working with.
I hope you will use this starter pack if you also like working with these features

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

## Tech

In this project i'm using the following tech:

- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [babel-plugin-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-styled-components)
- [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)
- [gatsby-plugin-favicon](https://github.com/Creatiwity/gatsby-plugin-favicon)
- [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
