# gatsby-starter-mabdulai

## Demo [https://gatsby-starter-mabdulai.netlify.com](https://gatsby-starter-mabdulai.netlify.com).

The default Gatsby starter adjusted by @mabdulai.

I created my own gatsby starter so I can easily start up a new project with the technologies I prefer working with.
I hope you will use this starter pack if you also like working with these features

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

## 🚀 Get started

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

    Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:

    ```sh
    # install the Gatsby CLI globally
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using this starter
    gatsby new my-gatsby-site https://github.com/mabdulai/gatsby-starter-mabdulai
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-gatsby-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    \_Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).\_

    Open the the `my-gatsby-site/` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ✨ What makes this package special?

### styled-components

This package uses some of my favourite packages. Most importantly [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/).
This is also comes with a babel plugin wich helps with the debugging of your styled components in the Dev-tools.

### gatsby-image

Next up is [Gatsby Image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/). This packages is amazing for handeling everything for you when it comes to images.
It handles all the following:

- Resize large images to the size needed by your design
- Generate multiple smaller images so smartphones and tablets don’t download desktop-sized images
- Strip all unnecessary metadata and optimize JPEG and PNG compression
- Efficiently lazy load images to speed initial page load and save bandwidth
- Use the “blur-up” technique or a ”traced placeholder” SVG to show a preview of the image while it loads
- Hold the image position so your page doesn’t jump while images load
